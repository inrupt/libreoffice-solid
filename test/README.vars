Environment variables in VCL:

LO_TEST_LOCALE - the locale to be used during unit tests. Defaults to en-US.
LIBO_TEST_DEFAULT_DESKTOP - define this to make tests run in current (active) desktop on Windows (by default, they run on a dedicated desktop, to avoid unwanted interaction with current UI session)
