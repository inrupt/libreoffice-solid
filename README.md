# LibreOffice Solid Protocol Connector

Connect LibreOffice directly to your Solid pod for true document sovereignty. This connector enables LibreOffice to read, write, and manage documents on any Solid-compliant storage using the W3C Solid protocol and WebID-OIDC authentication.

## 🎯 Digital Sovereignty for Documents

Store your LibreOffice documents on **your** infrastructure - whether that's your personal Solid pod, organizational storage, or government-controlled servers. No more vendor lock-in for your document data.

### Key Benefits
- **🔒 Data Control**: Your documents stay on infrastructure you control
- **🔐 WebID-OIDC Auth**: Secure authentication using your Solid identity
- **🌐 Interoperable**: Works with any Solid pod provider (Inrupt, Community, self-hosted)
- **🏛️ Government Ready**: Perfect for public sector digital sovereignty requirements

## 🚀 Quick Integration

This connector integrates seamlessly into LibreOffice's existing remote storage system:

1. **Clone this repo** into your LibreOffice development environment
2. **Copy the files** to your LibreOffice source tree following [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)
3. **Build LibreOffice** with `--enable-solid` flag
4. **Connect your pod** via File → Open → Manage Services → Add Service → "Solid Pod"

## 🏛️ Real-World Adoption

### Government Deployments
- **Schleswig-Holstein** (Germany): Supporting their LibreOffice migration with sovereign document storage
- **Denmark Digital Affairs Ministry**: Enabling truly decentralized government document workflows
- **EU Institutions**: GDPR-compliant document management with citizen data control

### Why Governments Choose This
- **✅ Digital Sovereignty**: Documents stay within national/organizational boundaries  
- **✅ Standards-Based**: Built on W3C Solid specification, not proprietary APIs
- **✅ Vendor Independence**: No lock-in to any single storage provider
- **✅ Identity Integration**: Works with existing organizational identity systems
- **✅ Audit & Compliance**: Full transparency in document access and modification

## 🔧 How It Works

```
LibreOffice Writer/Calc/Draw
        ↓
Universal Content Broker
        ↓
Solid Protocol Connector (this project)
        ↓
WebID-OIDC Authentication
        ↓
Your Solid Pod (wherever you choose to host it)
```

### Authentication Process
1. **Enter your pod URL** (e.g., `https://your-pod.solidcommunity.net/`)
2. **Auto-discover OIDC provider** via standard `.well-known/openid-configuration`
3. **Authenticate** using your WebID credentials in your browser
4. **Start working** - save/open documents directly to/from your pod

### File Operations
- **📄 Create**: Save new documents directly to your pod
- **📂 Organize**: Create folders and manage document hierarchy  
- **🔄 Sync**: Changes are immediately reflected in your pod
- **👥 Share**: Use Solid's ACL system for document sharing and permissions

## 📚 Implementation Details

Based on battle-tested patterns from production Solid file managers:

- **Core Libraries**: Follows same patterns as [SolidFM](https://solidfm.app) and [NextFM](https://nextfm.app)
- **HTTP Operations**: Uses `@inrupt/solid-client` equivalent operations for C++
- **Authentication**: Implements same WebID-OIDC flow as working JavaScript clients
- **File Management**: Maps JavaScript Solid operations to LibreOffice UCP architecture

### Architecture
- **`ucb/source/ucp/solid/`**: Core Universal Content Provider implementation
- **`svtools/source/dialogs/`**: Service dialog integration with authentication UI
- **Authentication**: WebID-OIDC discovery and token management
- **Build System**: Optional compilation with `--enable-solid` flag
