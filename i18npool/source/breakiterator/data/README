The originals of these come from svn checkout

longer appear in the icu tarballs, but are in icu's svn

dict_word is used for dictionary word break, edit_word is for cursor
travelling, while count_word is for word count.

At various stages these copies have been customized and are now horribly out of
sync. It unclear which diffs from the base versions are deliberate and which
are now accidental :-(

The various issues and customizations have been reviewed, with tests written for
customizations that are still relevant. However, these files are still extremely
out-of-date and need to be refreshed. Relevant customizations should be reapplied
on top of a current version.

done, regression tests added:

- The intentions behind the following commits are unclear, as the referenced bugs were in the
StarOffice internal bug tracker. These changes are contemporaneous with TR14 Revision 17, and seem
to be part of an effort to backport upstream rule changes across multiple language customizations.

- The intention behind the following commit is unclear, as the bug references are incorrect and no
good candidates were immediately apparent. Based on the text of the commit, however, it appears to
be a simple bug fix for skipSpace(). This function has also had a great deal of churn since this
commit, further suggesting it is no longer pertinent.
